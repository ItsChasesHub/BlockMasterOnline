# Security Policy for Reporting Vulnerabilities
# Security Policy for Block Master Backend
# Last Updated: March 27, 2025

Thank you for taking the time to help improve the security of the Block Master application. 
I value the security community’s efforts in identifying and responsibly reporting vulnerabilities. 
This policy outlines the process for reporting security issues, what we expect from researchers, and how I’ll respond to your reports.

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Block Master Backend, please follow these steps to report it responsibly:

# Contact Method:
Primary Contact: Reach out via Discord at @itsexlipsez.

# Please do not post vulnerabilities publicly (e.g., on GitHub, X, or other platforms) until they have been resolved and we’ve agreed on a disclosure timeline.

Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue (e.g., do not modify or delete data in the LeaderboardScores collection).
Do not access or attempt to access other users’ data (e.g., leaderboard scores, names).
Avoid causing harm to the application or its users (e.g., do not attempt a DoS attack).

# What to Expect After Reporting:
I am are committed to working with security researchers to address vulnerabilities promptly and responsibly. Here’s what you can expect after submitting a report:

# Acknowledgment:
I will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours via Discord (@itsexlipsez).
If you don’t receive a response within 48 hours, please send a follow-up message to ensure your report was received.

# Investigation:
I will investigate the reported vulnerability and assess its impact on the Block Master Backend.
I may reach out to you for additional details or clarification during the investigation.

# Resolution Timeline:
I aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities (e.g., data exposure, unauthorized access) within 7 days of acknowledgment.
For less severe issues (e.g., rate limit bypass without significant impact), I aim to resolve within 14 days.
If a fix requires more time (e.g., due to dependencies on Render or MongoDB Atlas), I’ll keep you updated on the progress.

# Fix and Disclosure:
Once the vulnerability is fixed, I’ll deploy the update to Render and notify you via Discord.
I’ll work with you to determine a suitable timeline for public disclosure (if desired). I typically aim for a 30-day disclosure window after the fix is deployed, but this can be adjusted based on the severity and your preference.
You’ll be credited for the discovery (e.g., in a blog post or changelog) unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

# Final State:
Thank you for taking the time to read as I have been working hard and heavy on this project!
